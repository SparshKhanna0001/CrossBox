### Paired Devices and Public Rooms — Internet Transfer
* Transfer files over the Internet between paired devices or by entering temporary public rooms.
* Connect to devices in complex network environments (public Wi-Fi, company network, iCloud Private Relay, VPN, etc.).
* Connect to devices on your mobile hotspot.
* Devices outside of your local network that are behind a NAT are auto-connected via the PairDrop TURN server.
* Devices from the local network, in the same public room, or previously paired are shown.

#### Persistent Device Pairing

Always connect to known devices

* Pair devices via a 6-digit code or a QR-Code.
* Paired devices always find each other via shared secrets independently of their local network. 
* Pairing is persistent. You find your devices even after reopening PairDrop.
* You can edit and unpair devices easily.

#### Temporary Public Rooms

Connect to others in complex network situations, or over the Internet.

* Enter a public room via a 5-letter code or a QR-code.
* Enter a public room to temporarily connect to devices outside your local network.
* All devices in the same public room see each other.
* Public rooms are temporary. Closing PairDrop  leaves all rooms.

### [Improved UI for Sending/Receiving Files](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/issues/560)
* Files are transferred after a request is accepted. Files are auto-downloaded upon completing a transfer, if possible.
* Multiple files are downloaded as a ZIP file
* Download, share or save to gallery via the "Share" menu on Android and iOS.
* Multiple files are transferred at once with an overall progress indicator.

### Send Files or Text Directly From Share Menu, Context Menu or CLI
